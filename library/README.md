![npm bundle size (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@lukekaalim/act)

A generic rendering library for hierarchical elements.

Basically, a react knockoff.

Render to HTML with `@lukekaalim/act-web`
or use 3D capabilites with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) using `@lukekaalim/act-three`.

Writing declarative user interfaces using components, state and side effects.

Pull the library apart and take a look at the modular
insides - develop your own renderer, reconciler, scheduler or any other core part
of act.

## Install
```bash
npm install @lukekaalim/act
```

## Usage
Take a look at the [Web Quickstart Guide](https://act.luke.kaal.im/quickstart).

## Why?

I wanted to understand how react worked, and also how I could write my own custom renderer. I ended up with a really bare-bones react clone with a smaller interface, so I thought it would be fun to share.
